In the bustling city of Technopolis, where the world's most brilliant minds gather, the prestigious Cognizance Club is renowned for its cutting-edge innovations and breakthrough technologies. Recently, the club developed a revolutionary machine-learning algorithm that could predict cyber threats with unprecedented accuracy. However, just days before the algorithm's official presentation, it was stolen from the club's secure servers.

The club's administration is in a state of panic. The algorithm, if fallen into the wrong hands, could be used for malicious purposes. The city's cybercrime unit is already on the case, but they need the help of the brightest minds to solve this mystery swiftly. The thief left a mp3 file, stating that if cracked, it would lead to the recovery of the stolen algorithm.

_<span style="color: #ADD8E6">Objective:</span>_

*You are tasked with recovering a file that was locked with an unknown password. The thief left behind a mp3(Morse code) file that used to find the secret key. Use your skills to solve the problem and recover the file.*


_<span style="color: #ADD8E6">Submission Guidelines:</span>_

- The report should include the following.

- The algorithm used to solve the task given. (Explanation)

- The Password to Unlock the PDF(Type the password in the report as "password is:---------")

- The **Secret code** present in the Cyber Threat Advanced Machine Learning Algorithm PDF.

- Note: Make a Document and Upload it in the GitHub directory.

_<span style="color: #ADD8E6">Hints:</span>_

- Cipher Code

```lua

fvHwSekvEf6bktVlrsW0FA==

```

- Mp3 File(Morse Code)

```lua

... ...-- -.-. .-. ...-- - -.- ...-- -.-- .--.-. .---- ..--- ...-- ....- ..... -....

```

- There Will be a Secret Key.

- You need to find out the key based on the given mp3 file*

- Use the Cipher text to find out the Password for the file
